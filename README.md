# Networks_Projects
This repository contains a udp-connection game, displayed by a GUI, designed to be played by 2 people on separate machines, a program to select the first player of a game (gameRandomizer.py) and display that name on a GUI, and a few other miscellaneous   programs written for my CSCI 420 Networks class. Everything is written in Python.
